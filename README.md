This project is about building a website that contains cooking instructions.
In this project I learned how to use the basic concepts in HTML that I have learned so far. I used different header levels on the pages. I also learned how to break text into paragraphs using the "p" tag and better understand the difference between ordered and unordered lists by displaying cooking instructions as a list using "ul" and "ol". Also, using the "img" tag, I placed images of different foods on different pages. Also made a link between the main page and other pages using the "a" tag.
